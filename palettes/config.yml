# scripts: These javascript files will be packaged and linked
# in order before any other .js files. File paths should be 
# specified relative to the project root. They should not be 
# compressed. 

# scripts:
# - scripts/lib/jquery-min.js
# - scripts/lib/underscore.js
# - scripts/lib/backbone.js


# add_remaining_scripts: (Yes or No) If Yes, all .js files in 
# the project will be packaged and linked to the main html 
# file. Files not included in the 'scripts' list will be 
# loaded in arbitrary order.
#
# If No, only the files listed in the scripts list will 
# be packaged and linked. Regardless, all script files will 
# be uploaded. You would only set 'add_remaining_scripts' to
# No if you were using a separate asset management library,
# like require.js
