# Backlift config.yml file. This file can be used to customize how 
# your application is packaged when you run backlift push.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# compile: Backlift will select an appropriate compiler for each file 
# that matches one of the patterns below. The file types that backlift 
# recognizes are:
#   *.jst        -> underscore templates (outputs .js files)
#   *.handlebars -> handlebars templates (outputs .js files)
#   *.less       -> lessc css compiler (outputs .css files)
#   *.coffee     -> coffeescript compiler (outputs .js files)
#
# Uncomment this block to customize which files will be compiled:

# compile:
# - **/*.jst
# - **/*.handlebars
# - **/bootstrap*.less
# - **/*.coffee


# scripts: These javascript files will be packaged and linked in 
# order. File paths should be specified relative to the project root.
# They should not be compressed. The * will match any string and **
# will match any folder.

scripts:
- libraries/scripts/jquery.js
- libraries/scripts/jquery.cookie.js
- libraries/scripts/underscore.js
- libraries/scripts/backbone.js
- libraries/scripts/bootstrap.js
- libraries/scripts/date.js
- libraries/scripts/handlebars.runtime.js
- libraries/scripts/backlift-backbone-helpers.js
- libraries/scripts/backlift-commonview.js
- libraries/scripts/**/*.js
- app/**/*.js


# styles: These stylesheets will be packaged and linked in order, 
# similar to scripts.

styles:
- libraries/styles/bootstrap.css
- app/**/*.css


# optimize: The optimize flag controls whether or not backlift 
# concatenates and minifies .js and .css files. The optimizer is slow
# and produces obfuscated code that cannot be easily debugged. For 
# these reasons, optimization should be disabled during development

optimize: no


# autoroute: the automatic routing feature is useful for single-page 
# websites that implement their own javascript routing. If autoroute
# is set to 'yes', all requests to URLs that don't match a file or API 
# endpoint will be routed to the index.html file. Default is 'no'.

autoroute: yes


# collections: When a document is saved to the server using one of the
# persistence URLs, the data will first be checked against the rules
# defined here. See the persistence documentation in the backlift docs
# at http://backlift.github.com/docs/validation.html#validation

collections:
  users:
    _public_permissions: { default: '', readonly: yes }
    _id: { type: 'auto:current_user', readonly: yes }


# packages: define sets of additional libraries or functionality that
# can be downloaded during app installation. Top-level key defines 
# package name. Inside package, each key is a folder name, and each 
# value is a github repository or gist. Github repos may specify a tag 
# or branch via a tree url.
