**init**: This template only contains a .backlift config file. It is used by the "backlift init" command.

**list**: This template includes a simple list of items that can be added and deleted.

**palettes**: Created by syntagmatic, this template provides a color picker interface inspired by the colorlovers website.

**todo**: The classic todo example, running on backlift.
